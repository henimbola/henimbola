I am a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more available. I love to create sample, to commit myself in programming technologies.
There are many technologies I love working with like React.js, Angular, Sring Boot, Express.js and so on. But I know that the most important topics in programming are to be good in algorithms, architectures, design patterns, etc. To be better at software engineering, I'm trying to code every day. I will be very happy to work with everyone in an open source project.
